to do list : change folder name "MY OFFICE ADD-in" ->"my_office_add-in"

I realized that I could build my project by using open api. I didn't need to build it by xingAPI which has COM object.
when I use xingAPI then the process will be more complicated cause it could be built in only 32 bit python environment.
So I decided that rebuild my application using websocket (wss protocol) in openAPI.
