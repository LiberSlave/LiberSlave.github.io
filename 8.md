xing API of LS is only offered by python 32bit environment. 
because of that I need to install Official 32-bit python from 
[python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

And I downloaded 32bit python at this direction
```
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313-32
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313-32\python.exe
```

right after I made a virtual environment
```
& 'C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313-32\python.exe' -m venv py13_32
```
and activate it
```
.\py13_32\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
